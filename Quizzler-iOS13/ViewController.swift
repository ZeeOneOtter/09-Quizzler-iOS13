Because questionNumber += 1 will happen, and although the if statement is such that it will continue onto else-part of the statement, the issue arises when the player presses the button another time. The variable questionNumber has now been saved last as something outside the array index by +1, thus if initalized and kept within if-statment then the issue of index error of questionNumber is avoided.*/
